# Brainstorm Session

Launches a creative brainstorming roundtable using the **Disney strategy** (Dreamer → Realist → Critic).

This strategy separates creative thinking from critical evaluation:
1. **Dreamer phase**: Think big, no constraints, what would be ideal?
2. **Realist phase**: What's feasible? How would we implement this?
3. **Critic phase**: What could go wrong? What risks should we address?

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Directory contents: !`ls -la`
- Timestamp: !`date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"`

---

## Interpret Context

Based on the Directory contents output, determine:

- **S2S initialized**: If `.s2s` directory appears in Directory contents → "yes", otherwise → "no"
- **Directory name**: Extract the last segment from the pwd output

---

## Instructions

### Parse Arguments

Extract from $ARGUMENTS:
- **topic**: Required. The subject for brainstorming (first quoted argument)
- **--participants**: Optional. Comma-separated list of participants to include

If topic is missing, ask user using AskUserQuestion:
- "What would you like to brainstorm?"
- Free text input

### Validate Environment

If S2S initialized is "no":
- Display warning: "Not an s2s project. Results will be displayed but not saved."
- Continue anyway (brainstorm can work without s2s setup)

### Determine Participants

Default participants for brainstorming:
- product-manager (user needs, business value)
- software-architect (structure, patterns)
- technical-lead (implementation, feasibility)
- devops-engineer (operations, deployment)

If --participants specified, use that list instead.

### Launch Brainstorm Roundtable

```
Task(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  prompt="Run a brainstorming roundtable using the Disney strategy.

=== SESSION INFO ===
Topic: {topic}
Strategy: disney
Workflow: brainstorm
Session ID: {timestamp}-brainstorm-{slug}

=== PARTICIPANTS ===
{list of participants}

=== DISNEY STRATEGY ===

PHASE 1: DREAMER
- Think BIG. No constraints.
- What would make this the best solution ever?
- What would delight users?
- Don't worry about feasibility yet.

Facilitator prompt: 'Imagine we have unlimited resources and time. What would the ideal solution look like?'

PHASE 2: REALIST
- Given the dreamer ideas, which are feasible?
- What would implementation look like?
- What resources would we need?
- What's the MVP vs full vision?

Facilitator prompt: 'Looking at these ideas, how could we actually make them happen? What are the practical steps?'

PHASE 3: CRITIC
- What could go wrong?
- What risks should we address?
- What are we missing?
- What assumptions need validation?

Facilitator prompt: 'What potential problems do you see? What could derail this? What should we be careful about?'

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

After completing all phases, synthesize into:

1. **Top Ideas** (from Dreamer phase)
   - Idea 1: description
   - Idea 2: description
   ...

2. **Feasibility Assessment** (from Realist phase)
   - Immediately feasible: [list]
   - Requires more work: [list]
   - Long-term/aspirational: [list]

3. **Risks & Mitigations** (from Critic phase)
   - Risk 1: mitigation
   - Risk 2: mitigation
   ...

4. **Recommended Next Steps**
   - Action 1
   - Action 2
   ...

5. **Unresolved Questions**
   - Question 1
   - Question 2
   ..."
)
```

### Save Results (if S2S initialized)

If S2S is initialized:

1. Create session directory if needed:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .s2s/sessions
   ```

2. Save summary to `.s2s/sessions/{timestamp}-brainstorm-{slug}.md`:

```markdown
# Brainstorm: {Topic}

**Session**: {session-id}
**Date**: {date}
**Strategy**: Disney (Dreamer → Realist → Critic)
**Participants**: {list}

## Dreamer Phase Ideas
