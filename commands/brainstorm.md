# Brainstorm Session

Launches a creative brainstorming roundtable using the **Disney strategy** (Dreamer → Realist → Critic).

This strategy separates creative thinking from critical evaluation:
1. **Dreamer phase**: Think big, no constraints, what would be ideal?
2. **Realist phase**: What's feasible? How would we implement this?
3. **Critic phase**: What could go wrong? What risks should we address?

## Context

- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Directory contents: !`ls -la`
- Timestamp: !`date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"`

---

## Interpret Context

Based on the Directory contents output, determine:

- **S2S initialized**: If `.s2s` directory appears → "yes", otherwise → "no"
- **Directory name**: Extract the last segment from pwd

---

## Instructions

### Parse Arguments

Extract from $ARGUMENTS:
- **topic**: Required. The subject for brainstorming (first quoted argument)
- **--participants**: Optional. Comma-separated list to override defaults

If topic is missing, ask using AskUserQuestion:
- "What would you like to brainstorm?"

### Validate Environment

If S2S initialized is "no":
- Display: "Warning: Not an s2s project. Results displayed but not saved."
- Continue anyway (brainstorm can work without full s2s setup)

### Determine Participants

Default participants for brainstorming:
- product-manager (user needs, business value)
- software-architect (structure, patterns)
- technical-lead (implementation, feasibility)
- devops-engineer (operations, deployment)

If --participants specified, use that list instead.

### Display Introduction

    Brainstorm Session Starting
    ═══════════════════════════

    Topic: {topic}
    Strategy: Disney (Dreamer → Realist → Critic)
    Participants: {list}

    Phase 1 (Dreamer): Think BIG, no constraints!
    Phase 2 (Realist): What's feasible? How to implement?
    Phase 3 (Critic): What could go wrong? What risks?

    Starting discussion...

### Launch Roundtable

**Invoke roundtable:start with brainstorm workflow and disney strategy:**

Use the SlashCommand tool:

    /s2s:roundtable:start "{topic}"
      --workflow-type brainstorm
      --strategy disney
      --participants {participant list}
      --output-type summary

The roundtable will:
- Create session file in `.s2s/sessions/` (if s2s initialized)
- Run Disney strategy: Dreamer → Realist → Critic phases
- Each phase generates focused discussion
- Return synthesized results for each phase

### Process Results

After roundtable completes, extract from session:

1. **Dreamer phase ideas**: Big thinking, no constraints
2. **Realist assessment**: Feasibility evaluation
   - Immediately feasible
   - Requires more work
   - Long-term/aspirational
3. **Critic risks**: Identified risks with mitigations
4. **Consensus recommendations**: Agreed next steps

### Save Results (if S2S initialized)

If S2S is initialized:

1. Session YAML already created by roundtable:start

2. Generate summary markdown `.s2s/sessions/{session-id}-summary.md`:

```markdown
# Brainstorm: {Topic}

**Session**: {session-id}
**Date**: {date}
**Strategy**: Disney (Dreamer → Realist → Critic)
**Participants**: {list}

## Dreamer Phase Ideas

{Ideas from phase 1}

## Realist Assessment

### Immediately Feasible

### Requires More Work

### Long-term Vision
{list}

## Critic Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| {risk} | {mitigation} |

## Recommended Next Steps
