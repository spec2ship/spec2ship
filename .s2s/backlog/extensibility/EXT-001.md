# EXT-001: Custom Agents in Project .claude/

**Status**: draft
**Priority**: medium
**Category**: Extensibility
**Created**: 2026-01-11
**Updated**: 2026-01-11

## Context

The user realizes that:
1. Each project may want specialized agents (e.g., project-specific code reviewer)
2. S2s development itself needs specialized agents not shipped with the plugin
3. These agents should be in `.claude/` of the project, not in the plugin

This is elegant because:
- Project-specific agents are version-controlled with the project
- S2s's own development agents are in s2s's `.claude/` folder
- No pollution of the plugin with dev-only tools

## Proposal

### 1. Agent Discovery

- Roundtable commands scan `.claude/agents/` in project
- Project agents available alongside plugin agents
- Naming: `project:{agent-name}` to distinguish

### 2. S2s Development Agents

- Create `.claude/agents/s2s-code-reviewer.md` in s2s repo
- Used during s2s development
- Not shipped with plugin (excluded by manifest or .gitignore in plugin build)

### 3. Agent Creation Command

- `/s2s:agent:create {name}` - wizard to create custom agent
- Generates template in `.claude/agents/`
- Asks for: role, expertise, workflow defaults, color

### 4. Project Agent Structure

```
.claude/
└── agents/
    └── {project}-code-reviewer.md
```

### Files to Create/Modify
- Discovery logic in commands
- `commands/agent/create.md` (new)
- `.claude/agents/s2s-code-reviewer.md` (for s2s development)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project agents discoverable by roundtable
- [ ] Agent creation wizard works
- [ ] S2s dev agents exist in s2s's .claude/
- [ ] Clear distinction between project and plugin agents

## Related

- Related to: QUAL-001 (Code Review Agent) - that agent would live here
- Related to: EXT-002 (Custom Participants)

## Open Questions

- How to handle naming conflicts between project and plugin agents?
- Should project agents be validated against a schema?
- How to document project agents for team members?

## Notes

This also solves the problem of where to put s2s-specific development tools - they go in s2s's own `.claude/` folder.
