# EXT-003: Migrate Command for Templates

**Status**: draft
**Priority**: low
**Category**: Extensibility
**Created**: 2026-01-11
**Updated**: 2026-01-11

## Context

If users create custom participants (EXT-002), and we update the base participant template (e.g., add new required section), user's custom participants become outdated.

## Proposal

### 1. Template Versioning

- Each participant template has version number
- Custom participants inherit version at creation time
- Plugin tracks current template version

### 2. Migration Command

- `/s2s:migrate participants`
- Scans custom participants
- Identifies outdated versions
- Applies updates (add new sections, update format)

### 3. Migration Safety

- Creates backup before modifying
- Shows diff before applying
- Allows selective migration

### Files to Create
- `commands/migrate.md` (new)
- Version tracking in templates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Template versioning in place
- [ ] Migrate command identifies outdated files
- [ ] Safe migration with backup
- [ ] Clear reporting of changes

## Related

- Depends on: EXT-002 (Custom Participants)

## Open Questions

- How to handle user customizations during migration?
- What if migration breaks user's custom logic?
- Automatic or manual migration trigger?

## Notes

This is a maintenance feature that becomes important only after EXT-002 is widely used.
