# EXT-002: Custom Participants Skill

**Status**: draft
**Priority**: low
**Category**: Extensibility
**Created**: 2026-01-11
**Updated**: 2026-01-11

## Context

Beyond project-specific agents (EXT-001), users may want to:
- Create entirely new participant types
- Modify existing participants for their domain
- Share custom participants across projects

## Proposal

### 1. Participant Creation Skill

- Skill that guides through participant creation
- Template-based with customization options
- Outputs proper agent file structure

### 2. Storage Options

- Local project: `.claude/agents/roundtable/`
- Plugin extension: Check if plugin allows user folders
- Fallback: Symlink or copy from shared location

### 3. Participant Template

```markdown
# {name}

## Metadata
- Workflow default: specs | design | brainstorm
- Color: {color}
- Model: inherit | opus | haiku

## Expertise
{domain expertise description}

## Critical Stance
{how this participant pushes back}
```

### Files to Create
- `skills/participant-creation/SKILL.md` (new)
- Template files for participant structure

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Skill for creating participants exists
- [ ] Created participants work in roundtables
- [ ] Multiple storage locations supported

## Open Questions

- How to ensure custom participants have required sections?
- Validation of custom participant structure?
- How to handle updates to base template?

## Notes

This builds on EXT-001 but provides a guided experience specifically for roundtable participants.
