# RT-001: Phases for All Workflows

**Status**: draft
**Priority**: medium
**Category**: Roundtable
**Created**: 2026-01-11
**Updated**: 2026-01-11

## Context

Currently, only brainstorm has explicit phases (dreamer → realist → critic from Disney strategy). Specs and design use topics/agenda items but no overarching phase structure.

Benefits of phases:
- Clear checkpoints for progress
- Natural points for context compaction
- Better isolation of concerns
- Easier to resume at specific phase

## Proposal

### 1. Phase Definitions by Workflow

**Specs Phases**:
- Discovery: Gather context, identify stakeholders, understand domain
- Definition: Define requirements, business rules, constraints
- Refinement: Clarify, resolve conflicts, prioritize

**Design Phases**:
- Architecture: High-level structure, key decisions
- Components: Detailed component design, interfaces
- Integration: Cross-cutting concerns, deployment

**Brainstorm Phases** (existing):
- Dreamer: Ideas without constraints
- Realist: Feasibility assessment
- Critic: Risk identification

### 2. Session Schema Extension

```yaml
phases:
  - id: "discovery"
    status: "completed"
    rounds: [1, 2, 3]
    checkpoint: true
  - id: "definition"
    status: "active"
    rounds: [4, 5]
    checkpoint: true
```

### 3. Phase Transitions

- Facilitator proposes phase transition
- User can approve or request more rounds
- On transition, suggest `/compact` to reduce context

### 4. Phase-Specific Behavior

- Different prompts/focus per phase
- Different artifact types per phase
- Phase summary generated at checkpoints

### Files to Modify
- `commands/specs.md`
- `commands/design.md`
- `agents/roundtable/facilitator.md`
- `skills/roundtable-execution/SKILL.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Phases defined for specs and design
- [ ] Session schema supports phases
- [ ] Facilitator can propose phase transitions
- [ ] Phase summaries generated at checkpoints
- [ ] `/compact` suggested at phase boundaries

## Related

- Related to: CTX-001 (context reduction via phase isolation)
- Related to: RT-004 (roundtable splitting)
- Supersedes: Old P3-7

## Clarifications

**Phases are MANDATORY** for all workflows (specs, design, brainstorm), but:
- In `--interactive` mode, user can **skip phases** at checkpoint prompts
- In `--interactive` mode, user can **express different preferences** via prompt
- Without `--interactive`, phases proceed automatically to completion

## Open Questions

- How to handle artifacts that span phases?
- What happens to skipped phase artifacts? (Mark as "skipped" in session?)
- Should there be a `--no-phases` flag for truly flat execution?

## Notes

This provides structure by default while allowing flexibility for experienced users.
