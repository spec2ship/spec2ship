# OUT-001: Parallel Transcriber Agent

**Status**: draft
**Priority**: low
**Category**: Output
**Created**: 2026-01-11
**Updated**: 2026-01-11

## Context

The user suggests having an agent that creates output ready for GUI consumption in parallel with the roundtable execution.

## Technical Findings

**Parallel subagent execution IS possible.** The current implementation already runs participants in parallel within each round. The transcriber could be launched alongside participants.

Implementation approach:
- Add transcriber to participant list for each round
- Transcriber receives same context as other participants
- Transcriber outputs to dedicated file instead of contributing to discussion

## Proposal

### 1. Transcriber Agent

- `agents/roundtable/transcriber.md`
- Receives same context as facilitator/participants
- Produces structured output (JSON/YAML)
- Runs in parallel with participants each round
- Has `tools: [Write]` to write output file

### 2. Output Format

```json
{
  "session_id": "...",
  "round": 3,
  "events": [
    {"type": "round_start", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"type": "artifact", "id": "REQ-001", "status": "proposed"},
    {"type": "position", "participant": "qa-lead", "stance": "support"}
  ]
}
```

### 3. Streaming Output

- Write to `.s2s/sessions/{id}/transcript.json`
- Append after each round
- Or WebSocket if GUI exists

### Files to Create
- `agents/roundtable/transcriber.md` (new)
- Modify commands to optionally include transcriber

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Transcriber agent created
- [ ] Runs in parallel with participants
- [ ] Produces structured JSON output
- [ ] Output usable by potential GUI
- [ ] Minimal impact on roundtable performance

## Related

- Related to: Future GUI considerations
- Related to: Session file (complementary, not replacement)

## Open Questions

- Is this worth the complexity without a GUI?
- Alternative: Post-process session file into GUI format? (Simpler, post-hoc)
- Should transcriber be opt-in (`--transcript`) or always on?

## Notes

Consider if post-processing the session file is simpler than real-time transcription.
